Hello..

In order to use this part you'll have to use the CMD.

Open two CMD's, CD to here with both.

On one of them copy this start rmiregistry

Hit enter, it should now have spun up the registry server.

Now you just copy this onto one of the two cmds

java Server

On the other one you merely copy this

java Client
